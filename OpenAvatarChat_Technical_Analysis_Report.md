## Introduction

**OpenAvatarChat** is a modular, open-source platform for real-time, interactive digital human (avatar) conversations. It supports multimodal input/output (text, audio, video), advanced avatars, and can run full-featured.

---

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Enable real-time, low-latency, multimodal conversations with digital avatars, supporting text, audio, and video modalities.
- **Design:** Highly modular, allowing easy swapping of ASR, LLM, TTS, and avatar engines.
- **Deployment:** Can run locally (with GPU/CPU) or leverage cloud APIs for lighter requirements.


---

## Core Features

### 1. **Low-Latency Real-Time Conversation**
- Average response delay: ~2.2 seconds (measured on high-end hardware).
- Optimized for interactive, natural-feeling dialogue.

### 2. **Multimodal Language Model Support**
- Handles text, audio, and video inputs/outputs.
- Supports advanced models like MiniCPM-o (vision, speech, streaming), OpenAI-compatible APIs, and more.

### 3. **Modular Architecture**
- Each component (ASR, LLM, TTS, Avatar) is a pluggable handler.
- Easily switch between local and cloud-based models.

### 4. **Avatar Diversity & Customization**
- Supports multiple avatar engines:
  - **LiteAvatar:** Lightweight, 2D, audio-driven face animation.
  - **LAM:** Ultra-realistic 3D avatars from a single image (customizable, concurrent, SIGGRAPH-published).
  - **MuseTalk:** High-fidelity, real-time lip-sync video avatars.


### 5. **Flexible Configuration**
- YAML-based config for easy customization.

### 6. **Advanced TTS & ASR**
- **CosyVoice:** Multilingual, low-latency, high-quality TTS (supports voice cloning, emotion, dialects).
- **SenseVoice:** Efficient ASR for real-time speech recognition.
- **EdgeTTS:** API-based TTS for lightweight deployments.
- **Silero VAD:** Fast, accurate voice activity detection.

### 7. **Concurrency & Scalability**
- LAM avatars support multi-channel concurrency.
- Designed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios.

### 8. **Extensive Documentation & Demos**
- Online demos (HuggingFace, ModelScope).
- Video demonstrations and detailed READMEs for each model/component.

## System Architecture & Workflow

### High-Level Data Flow



**Typical Pipeline:**
1. **Input:** User provides audio, video, or text.
2. **VAD:** Voice Activity Detection (Silero VAD) segments speech.
3. **ASR:** Audio is transcribed to text (SenseVoice or MiniCPM-o).
4. **LLM:** Text (and optionally video/audio) is processed by the language model (MiniCPM-o, OpenAI-compatible, etc.).
5. **TTS:** LLM output is synthesized to speech (CosyVoice, EdgeTTS, etc.).
6. **Avatar:** Audio/text drives avatar animation (LiteAvatar, LAM, MuseTalk).
7. **Output:** Rendered avatar video/audio is streamed to the user.

### Modular Handler System
- Each stage (ASR, LLM, TTS, Avatar) is a handler, loaded dynamically based on config.
- Handlers communicate via typed data queues (audio, text, video, motion data, etc.).
- Supports both local and remote (API) inference.

### Supported Modalities
- **Input:** Audio (mic), Video (camera), Text
- **Output:** Audio, Video (avatar), Text

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - Full local mode (MiniCPM-o unquantized) requires >20GB VRAM.
  - Quantized models (int4) can run on <10GB VRAM but with reduced quality.
  - Some features (MuseTalk) require GPU, not CPU.
- **LiteAvatar:** No custom avatar support (use LAM for customization).
- **Concurrency:** LiteAvatar does not support multi-channel concurrency; LAM does.
- **Voice Cloning:** MiniCPM-o supports, but quality may lag behind dedicated TTS models.

- **Resolution:** MuseTalk avatars limited to 256x256 face region.
- **Identity Preservation:** Some avatar engines may not perfectly preserve facial details.
- **Jitter:** Single-frame generation in MuseTalk can cause jitter.
- **Documentation:** Some advanced features require reading model-specific docs.
