- **Intersection Observer** - Efficient scroll animations
- **Image Optimization** - SVG usage for scalable graphics

### 3.2 Recommended Performance Improvements

**Core Web Vitals Optimization:**

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s:**
   ```javascript

   <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/images/img_hero.webp" />

   <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//fonts.googleapis.com" />
   <link rel="preconnect" href="//api.company.com" />
   ```

2. **First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms:**
   - Implement React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
   - Use React.memo() for expensive component renders
   - Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1:**
   - Add explicit dimensions for images and videos
   - Reserve space for dynamic content
   - Implement skeleton loading screens

**Advanced Optimization Techniques:**

1. **Image Optimization:**
   ```javascript

   const ImageComponent = ({ src, alt }) => (
     <picture>
       <source srcSet={`${src}.webp`} type="image/webp" />
       <source srcSet={`${src}.avif`} type="image/avif" />
       <img src={`${src}.jpg`} alt={alt} loading="lazy" />
     </picture>
   );
   ```

2. **Code Splitting Implementation:**
   ```javascript

   const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'));
   const AboutPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/About'));

   const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./components/HeavyComponent'));
   ```

3. **Service Worker Implementation:**
   ```javascript

   self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
     if (event.request.destination === 'image') {
       event.respondWith(cacheFirst(event.request));
     }
   });
   ```

**Monitoring & Analytics:**
- **Core Web Vitals Tracking** - Real user monitoring
