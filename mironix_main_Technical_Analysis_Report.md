## 4. Performance Optimization Strategies

### Current Performance Issues
- Large image files (1.2-1.5MB each) without optimization
- No lazy loading implementation
- No image format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- No content delivery network (CDN) usage
- No code splitting implementation

### 4.1 Image Optimization
```javascript

- Convert to WebP/AVIF formats
- Implement responsive images with srcset
- Add lazy loading for background images
- Use image compression tools
- Implement progressive image loading
```

### 4.2 Code Optimization
```javascript

const Partnership = lazy(() => import('./components/Partnership'));
const Hero = lazy(() => import('./components/Hero'));


npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
npm run build && npx webpack-bundle-analyzer build/static/js
```

### 4.3 Caching & CDN
- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- Add CDN for static assets delivery
- Implement browser caching strategies
- Use HTTP/2 server push for critical resources

### 4.4 Runtime Performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Add performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals)
- Optimize re-rendering with React.memo
- Implement debouncing for user interactions

### 4.5 Loading Performance
```javascript
// Critical CSS inlining
// Preload critical fonts and assets
// Implement skeleton screens
// Add performance budgets
```

## 5. Scalability & Technical Debt

### 5.1 State Management
**Current**: No centralized state management
**Recommendation**: Implement Redux Toolkit or Zustand for complex state

### 5.2 TypeScript Migration
**Current**: JavaScript only
**Recommendation**: Gradual migration to TypeScript for better maintainability

### 5.3 Testing Coverage
**Current**: Basic testing setup
**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for user flows
- End-to-end tests with Cypress/Playwright
- Visual regression testing

### 5.4 Error Handling
**Current**: No error boundaries
**Recommendation**: Implement error boundaries and logging

```javascript

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

}
```
